Dear students ✨🙌🏻

You are going to have a midterm on 7th week (your practice time).

📑You will be given 1 problem (similar to your lab problems or even easier) and approximately 10 minutes to solve it in empty workspace. Problem is just an example to check the knowledge of concepts enlisted in a checklist. So, make sure to revise them carefully. 

You may be asked additional questions from the list. Nothing we didn’t talk about.
